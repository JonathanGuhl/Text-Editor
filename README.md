# Text-Editor

## Description
- This is progressive web application that also uses IndexedDB. It's a simple text editor that's implemented using webpack and it creates a service worker for you to cache things for you if you run the PWA offline. 

## Installation 

- First you'll clone this repository.

- Once you've done that and `cd` into the correct directory you'll run an `npm install` while having the terminal open from the `client` folder and then you'll run another `npm install` while having the terminal open from the server folder. 

- After that you'll run an `npm start`. That will spin up the localhost server for you where you can then run it locally. 

- If you do not wish to run it locally you can just go to my deployment [here](https://stark-cliffs-20391.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

- There's really nothing special here in terms of usage that you need to know about. It's a text editor so feel free to save code here or whatever you'd like to put in a text file. You can also install the app if you'd like by clicking the install button. You can use the app offline if you'd like. 

- You should expect to see this in the browser if you run it locally or through the deployment
